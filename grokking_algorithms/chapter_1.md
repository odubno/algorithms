# Binary Search
- the input has to be sorted
- keep taking the half way point


## Logarithms
- You may not remember what logarithms are, but you probably know what exponentials are. log10 100 is like asking, “How many 10s do we multiply together to get 100?” The answer is 2: 10 × 10. So log10 100 = 2. Logs are the flip of exponentials.
- When you search for an element using simple search, in the worst case you might have to look at every single element. So for a list of 8 numbers, you’d have to check 8 numbers at most. For binary search, you have to check log n elements in the worst case. For a list of 8 elements, log 8 == 3, because 23 == 8. So for a list of 8 numbers, you would have to check 3 numbers at most. For a list of 1,024 elements, log 1,024 = 10, because 210 == 1,024. So for a list of 1,024 numbers, you’d have to check 10 numbers at most.
